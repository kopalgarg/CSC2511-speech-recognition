I used the Voice Memo app on my Macbook to collect three recordings of me saying the following sentences. The files were in .mp4 
format, and had to be converted to .wav using an online conversion tool. 

"How to wreck a nice beach"
--> HOW TO WRECK THE NICE SPEECH
"How to recognize speech"
--> HOW TO RECOGNIZE SPEECH
"Potatoes"
--> POTATOES

I used speechbrain (script below for reference) to transribe my recordings. I decided to use "how to wreck a nice beach" and 
"how to recognize speech" as it is an example that has been used quite a lot in class, and I was curious to see how a state-of-the-alternative
ASR system would be able to transcribe such similar sounding sentences. As seen above, the transcripts were mostly right, with the 
exception of "a" being transcribed to "the", which could have been a problem with the audio, or the way I pronounced it. 


Python Script:
import speechbrain as sb
from speechbrain.dataio.dataio import read_audio
from IPython.display import Audio


from speechbrain.pretrained import EncoderDecoderASR

asr_model = EncoderDecoderASR.from_hparams(source="speechbrain/asr-crdnn-rnnlm-librispeech", savedir="pretrained_models/asr-crdnn-rnnlm-librispeech")
asr_model.transcribe_file('speechbrain/asr-crdnn-rnnlm-librispeech/example.wav')

recording = 'beach.wav'
asr_model.transcribe_file(recording)
