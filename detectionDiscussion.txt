Q: Is there a trend in performance with different hidden sizes? 
With an increase in hidden size from 5 to 10, we see an increase in the test 
accuracy, but changing it to 50 causes a significant decrease. In general,
adding more hidden neurons will increase the number of weights, increasing the 
model complexity. For simpler tasks, this could be unnecessary. With too few hidden layers, we 
get a low test accuracy and a high generalization error due to underfitting. With too many 
hidden layers we see low accuracy due to overfitting and high variance. Based on this experiment
it seems like 10 might be the optimal hidden size for this task.
